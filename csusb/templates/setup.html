<p class="lead">We are interested in comparing how well people do when they complete
strategy tasks as a part of a team competition versus when they complete
at the same time individually. To determine who will complete the tasks
individually or as a team, you will play a few rounds of CSUSB Survivor
with four other players. In each round, you will complete a short test
of your "survivor" intelligence. If you "survive" the first two rounds
you will go on to complete a series of strategy games with the remaining
members of your team. Your team will compete against two other teams for
a chance to win 1, 3, or 5 lottery tickets for a $100.00 draw. If you
play in a team, you will be guaranteed to win at least one lottery
ticket. If you get eliminated during the first two rounds of CSUSB
Survivor, you will complete the same strategy tasks, but alone and
without the chance to win lottery tickets.</p>
